The Abbey Choreh⁸ (which wat first built by Harold and
afterwards reedihed by Henry ll.) was a Gothielr Building,
rather large than neat, firm than seir. The great Pillars now
remaining are wreathed with Indentings, ‘und those Vacuities
were formerly, as it is confidenrly reported by some, fill’d np

· with Brass‚ which added much to the Beautyos the Building. ,

’ ’ The Steeple stood in the middle os the Church; but being
pulled down, *the foundations os ¹it were blown up by
underminers‚ aud the whole Choir part, the Cross Isles,

und the East Chapell of the Church were denlolisued‚ and

so nothing os it was lest standing, save the West End os the
Bodyos it (with the Sldellles) which is about 30. Yards

long, aud16.Yardsbroad, and is stnce the Dissolutiou be·

corne the Paroehial Choreb, and is adorned by the' Parilhi·

oners at their own Costb with aTower Steeple‚ whichir

= built ¹nt the Wesi End, and uno. Feet iu height from the

· Foundation to the Battletnents.

Tho' Fuller hath published the ffistory os this Abbey‚ yet
he hath neglesked to give an Account of it’s Abbatn; which
au Ι’ look upon as avery great Omissron, soi admire the more
at it, because l had an opportunity os extrusiing excellent
Materials about them from the Leiger Book os this Abbey,
in the Custody os the Right Honourable the Earl of Carlisse‚
written by RubentFuller the last Abbat. Had he inlarged
his Histoty hy insertinga Chapter upon this Subjesl, he would
have deserred much better os those Readers that hare the
Curiosrty pf perusrng what he hath done about this Plaee,
and he wouldhave saved me some Pains, which Ι must now
be obliged to undergo, in order to supply this Desed't os his
