A View os the Mitred Abbeys,

should be the first Abbat in England in Order and Dignity. ,
, After which Pope Honorius ΑΟ. 1218. confirmed to the Ab· ¹
bat and his Successore Episcopal Rights, and exempted them t
from the Jurisdlsiion os the Bilhop of Liucoln their Dioce· J

elder in creation. ,

The privileges os this Monastery being, as before men· Ἴ
tioned, very grear, the Monks took no less care to adorn 5
magnificently their Buildings, which will be seen more par· ¹
ticularly in the Lives of the Abbats‚ who were the chief Pro· η
moters of this Grandeur. The Strudture of the Church still 3
remains‚ being the chief Ornament os the Town, and owes ³
it’s Preservation, no doubt, to it's last Abbat Boreman’s pur· l
chasrng it ; and pity it is that the Gloysters, Chapter-House, 1
a‘nd other Offices were not likewise preserved from the Sacri· ¹

liihed them. Astu the Monkish Verses and Historical ¹

Paintings in the Cloys-lers, Library, &e taken from the Bibie 1
and Portraitures of famous Meu in the Wiudows, they may
be seen in the Monaslicon·, which I {hall therefore pass
by, and only take notice that those Builtliugs seem to have ,
been osa newer aud more elegant sirusiure than the Abbey·
Church it sels, as were, no doubt, the Abbacy and other ,
Offices, whose Gate is now standing, and is very large, lead· η

Remains of tlte Abbey.

The Shrine l of St. Alban was also very sumptuous, as
were the Altar aud Brass Font brought out os Scotland ind
scarce to be equalled in any Church. The first is intirely
gone, and there is only this inscribed ou a modern black

Golden and Silver ornaments are gone. As to the latter,
there is one preserved in Wood which represents the Fa-
shion and Molee of the Brass one. I shall not here mention
the Epitaphs o's those Noble Persons that were siaiu in those
two famous Battles between the Houses of York and Lan· ¹
