that it was amostgoodiy Abbey. ¹ Ilhall givea short account

of it from Leland²z t »
“ The Abbey Church is a right magnificent thing, where

“ were two Steeplos‚ one that had arnighty high Pyramio, ‘

“ and fell dangeroussy down in hominum‘ memoria. It llood
“ in the middle of the Church, and wasa Mark to all the
“ Country about. The other Steeple is ugreet square Towet
‘⁸ at the West End of the Church.’' 0 Ι

“ Thereb were in the Abbey 'Church Yard two other
“ Churches, one of which was a little Church joining to the
“ South Side of the Abbey Church.’' 1 ’

“ The ⁰ other stands ot some distance.” After the Disso-
lution the sarne Author tells us, that one Stump‚ an exceed
ing rich Clothier‚ bought the Lodgings of the Abbey os the
King, and that alt the Abbey Offices were full os Loorns to

weave Clonth, and that he intended to mokea Street or two ’

for Clothiers of the vacant Ground of the Abbey, and that
Weavers had Loonis in the little Church. This Stump, he

olsoinforms us, was the chief Causer and Contributer to s ’

have the Abbey Church made a Parish Church.

The Remains ol this noble Abbey Church may ‘be seen
by the Dranght in the Monostieon, which tho’ it be not
abovea third Part oiit, yet it plainly lhews it to have been
a most goodly Strudlure, and equal, is not superior, to most

os our Cathedrals in England. The Spire Steeple in the -

Middle and Tower at the West End made it very much re·
semble the earhedrat of Hereford3 but these as well as the
great Cross Ille, Choir, Cloystern, and Chapter-House being
all intirely demolished‚ that part which yet stondeth is the
Body or Nave os the Church, and is walled up at ench End
between the two Steeples‚ being in Length about 140. Feet,
and about 100. in Breadth.

The Abbaey and the other Offices ore much ruined‚ the s

whole Town deeayed, and the Market in a great measurelost.
The chief Ornament os the Town, besides this Church, is
the goodly MarketCros . ¹ · ‘ ’

Το the Description we have giren we must add, That ,

the Abbey consisted of a very large spatious Body, witha
fine Western Front and Torret, alarge Steeple in the middle
Cross Isse and Choir &o and thar the Steeples were reple·
nished with large Betis, no less than ten whereof were, as
the inhabitants say, in the Middle Torret, and tivo in the
Western one. On one of the Bells belonging to this Abbey
was this inscriptione
