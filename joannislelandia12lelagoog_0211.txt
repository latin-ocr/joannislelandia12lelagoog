He was interred in the Place where was afterwards, as Fuller
acquaints usb, the Leaden Fountain in the Earl of Carlille’s
Gaudeo, which was then probably the End of the chon, or

rather some Eastern Chapell beyond it· This Garden lately ,

belonged to one Jonee, and 1 was extremely delighred when

of rich grey Marble, that there was a sort of Crols Flory up-
on thelame, and thar it was supported with Pillarers. For

much; but by the Munificence of the succeeding Kings it
recovered it self and ‘flourished again: and among other Pri·
vileges granted to theru, they were exempt from Episcopal
