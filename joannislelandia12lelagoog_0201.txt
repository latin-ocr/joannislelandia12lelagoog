ln the Market Place of Abbington² wasa right goodly
Cross of Stone with fair Degrees aud lmrgery, and there
used to be great Rejoicings b at Abbiufton onssthe Fealls of
the Fraternity of the Holy Crols. ln ormer times most ot
⁶ the Villages about Abbingtou had only Chnpells of uase,
and Abbingtou Church was the Mother Church', and it was
here that they buried.

' At the West End of the Area* wherein theAbbey Church
of Abbington stood was a Charnell Chapell, to which were
nittenowe ⁰wr¹lwnwllr0ssth ludi
but the Tithes llill gevllong to Abbiugton, ancl are ypaillarltl
the Minister of St. Nicholas's. All the Lands θ almost be·
tween Eynsham aud Dorcheller belong’d to the Abbey of
Abbiu tou. ¹

Intlu Abbey Church were buried Cissa Father to King
Iua; St. Edward'King aud Martyr, (who was brought up
here, as some say, in his tender Age 3) St. Vinceut aMartyr ’ς
Sidemanuet Bilhop of creditor, allas Kitron, near Exeter,
(andnot at Creditou, asGodwiu hwill hare it ;) Rohert de
Oilly and Aldith his wne, (who were interred iu a fine Tomb
ou the North srde of the lligh Ahar 3) besides many of the
Besrlles, and abundauce of other Persous of Note, particu-
larly from the Neighbouring Country, upon account of it¹s
being, (as l have observ'd) the Mother Church to all the
Villages hereabouts. But there is nothing now remaiuiu
'either of all these fine Monuments or of the Abbeywit seli,
save only the Gate-House. However, that Posterity may
have some Idea of the Splendour and Magnificence of the
Strudlure, Ilhall aequaiut them from Mr. Leland i, that it
had a moll stately Front at the West End, with two Towers,
belides another in the middle 3 and there is no doubt but all
its Offices‚ Cloysters, Chapter-House, Library, &e w'ere
equally fine and magnificent, and that the whole Pile was ,
not inferior to any other Abbey. From whence lt is easy to
