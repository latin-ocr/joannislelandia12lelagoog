That the Mannor of Wlnchelconrbe wirhthe Site of the
Abbty belonged to the Lotd Chandos foou after the Dillo
lurion, and that it continued in that Family 'till the Year

out lllue it came by his Gift to his Widow and Relid't jane,
Daughter of John Enlhiwre, who afterwards marrying with
George Pitts Esq; of Stratfeildffiey Corn. ,Southarnpn lbe
brought it to that Family, or at least her Hulbend enjoyed
it in her Right. And as to Dr. Lloyd‚ he held this Mannor

, only by virtue ofa considerable Leafe which was purchased

by his first Wife's Relations named Poland; ⁶ and so he was

The Parilh Church above merrtioned is llill standin ; bnt
therlhbey harh been long srnoe demolilhed, and the sire
turned into arable Ground. Ι have endeavoured to procure
aDreugbt of tlre Abbey, that by that means we might un-
derstand what aSort of Fabrick irvas. But my Attemprs
thia way have proved very nnfnccelsful, notwithstanding 1
vent thither, with no otherDelign‚ in September 1714. Ι
surreyed the Ground where itllood (which was on tlre North
Ball-fide of the Church) very exaflly‚ and tho' I could not ,
meet with fo much as a Storte standing, yet it wat no small l
bethfaflion to me thari bad wallted over the Soil on which ¹
tuis large Pile ot· building was erefled, and where there had
been formerly fuch a Nunrber of Perfons (famous for their
Birth, Letrniug‚ Piety and Virtue) interred, which Thing

and deterred those that were imployed loon after the Dillo·
lution (by the Lotd scyrrum, as l conceive) to pull ir down
and destroy it. Aslwas purluing these Religious lnquirieS‚

me to the Plaoe where rhe Church stood, and told me that
he bad frequently heard, particularly when he wasa Yonth‚
that the Tovrer of it was large and fine, but th'at there was
nothing left standing of the hbbey within his own Memory

except afew Offices, which wne probably those where the
Abbat's Hau Hine or chief Ploughman lived.
