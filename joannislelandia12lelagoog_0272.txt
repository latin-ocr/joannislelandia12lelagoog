given to it very iareiy‚ viz. in the fifth of Hen. 8. it insted
a very ihort time, being dissolved with the other Abbeys in
the same King's Reign. Since which the Chureh, which,
befides our Ladys² Chapeli, was an 126.'grffts‚ Panes, or
Yards in Length, and was amngnificent Building, is intirely
pulled down, The Kirchin, which was left standing of late
' YearS, tho' now raised to the Foundat’ron, was a large square
Room‚ open rothe Roof, which was composed 'of elegant
Workmtnthip. -The Chapter-House is likewiseruinedt It 1
ἶ wasa Pile of great Beauty, built as round as can poffinybe i
marked witha Compass3 and yet the Dimenfiens thereof κ
were large, there being 36. Sents in the Insrdewrought out i
in the walls, ali arch'd over Head with curione carved Stones.

being of great Length, Brendih and Height. The Saron

who was here butiod, as were his Son (whose Effigieswas oi κ
great Length) and St. Ruthond, a SaxonSaint, to whom and
to St. Maty the Cburch was dedicated. Adjoyning to thir r
