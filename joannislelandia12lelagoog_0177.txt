1 have been the more inclined to borrow this Passage from

Leland‚ because ιι clears what Sir Robert Atiins hath bee'n

pleased to observe about tlte Church, utho hath expressed ’
himself with so little cantion, that oue would think from hie 1

Account that the present Parilh Church wis the Abbey
Church; and yet his saying that it is dedicated to St. Peter,
and the Abbey Church to St. Marys rs a proosto sacch as well
