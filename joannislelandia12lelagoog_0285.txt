SIR, Scruton August rst. 17'14.

H 0⁹ Ι have thus long deferred my thanks for your
T Company when Iwas last at Oxford‚ Ι Ν111 affure

you 1 was no ways unmindful either of that, or the

promise Ι made you of sending the several additions Νι

Roads. Ι theu acquainted you with my mistake about the
Foſje near leicester, occasioned by the names of Fostoa and
'Great and Little stretton given to three Towns lying on the
East fide of the River Soar, which mitiead me being an en·
