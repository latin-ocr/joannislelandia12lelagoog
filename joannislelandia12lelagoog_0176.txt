1 64 · ’ A view of the Mitred Abbeys, · ι

This good Man continuing Abbat 'till towards the Dissolu-
tion, with an Intent not to surrender ‚his House for a pro·
phane Use, was, at length, by the Contrivance'and Tricks
of Cromwell, Secretary of State to Hen. VIII. perswaded to
refign his Pastoral Staff to one
, 53. Pfflm HAFORD, HAwFoRD, alias BALLARD ², a
young Monk of this Hense, who thereby commencing Abbat i
ἱ Anno 1539. yielded up the same to the'King's Use (much to
the DIscontent of Lichfeild) 'and had not only a Penfion of
24ol. per an. but afterwards the Deanery of Worcester con-
ferred'on him, which he held 'till his Death, which happened
Anno 1 5 57. He was the last Abbat of this House, and was bu-
ried at Worcester. When 1 was at Worcester Ι was shewed
his Monument, which is the Effigies of a Man cut in Stone,
with a Mitre and Crofier, lyIng on an Altar Monuinent. Itis
in a Chapellxon the South Side of the Choir. T ho' there be
no Inscription to confirm this Account, yet the Persouthat
[hewed the Church affured me that it had been a constant
Tradition that it was for the last Abbat of Evestxam.

1 am not capable of g‘1ving ar‘i account of the first Abbats,

the Histories of this Place being very imperfe& for the first
200. YearS. Insomuch that Richard Kedermister, the ’last Ab·
bat but one, in his History of the Foundation of‘this,Abbey‚
begins with Germanae, who was made Abbat by King Edgar.
W‘hence Ι conclude that the Books and Records he had met
with were so obscure that he could colle& little from them.
