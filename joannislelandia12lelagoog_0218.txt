the less lamented‚ tho’ the Abbey was no very old Building,

septum or great Cross isse bom East to West in the middle
oi the Cburcb, (where no doubt was an high'Tower) be·
‘yond which was the Choir, andfptobabiy a Chapell dedicated
ro St. Mary, was a new Work, tho' the East Parts appeared
tabe an oid Buiidiag.
As to the Monuments in the Abbey Church, 1 must not
Ι pretend to be particular on that account, having as yet met
with no better Relation than what is left us by Leland, who
tells Ρ os, that Rembaldus, Chancellor to King Edward the
Confeiior and Dean of the Coll'ege before it war converted
⁸ intoan Abbey, was buried in the Body of the Church ina
’ Sepulchre Crois of white Marble with this Inscription: Hic
jacet Rambaldrrs presbyter, quondam hujus ecrlrfiae dranus, d
tmepore Edwardr' Regis Angtiae concellarius. In another Plao
he ⁶ tebeth, that Noblemen of St. Amenda were here buried
io the Prerytery (which was the most Eastern Part of the
Church beyond the Choir) and that the beart of Sentiat, wife
to Richard King of the Romansand Earl oi Corowali, war
brriedinrhesameplace. Ἴ

taki up Arma in behalf of Rich. ΙΙ. against Hen.1V.wert y
hereniurprized, and talting‘¹ Sant'tuary in this Abbey were
eiolently brought forth and beheaded. Their Bodier being

iham in the County of Berks.

When Sir Robert Arkina was. about the Antiquities oi
monaster-thim, Isent him arr Account of the Abbatsof
thie, as well as of some other Abbeys in that County. But g
several material Mistakes hare been committed in the print·
ing those Accounts, and therefore when he and i are found
¹todiffer from one another, I delire that what Ι now pubiiih t
rrray be look’d upon as much more corre& and complete than
what appears in that Work, and that the Faults to be rnet ·;
with there were not occasioned by arry Negligenre of mint. i
