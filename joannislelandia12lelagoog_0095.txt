that is a Book called, Notitia Monastica, or a [hort History of

pubiffhed oy the Reverend ond berned Dr. Thomas Tanner,
Chancelloi of Norwich and Prehendnry of Ely. This Book

(which is in 8⁷⁰.) was printed ot the Theatre in Oxford in'¹

the Year 169 ς. The' theAuthor was then only Batchelonr of

Arte, yet it isa very jndicious'Peeformnnce‚ and by it he heth
deservedly obtained a great ond very distingnyhing Charocter

and deputativa amongst the most learned ‘and ”¹¹st celebrated
