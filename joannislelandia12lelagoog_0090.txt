only acquaints tn, thatshe' was remearant obscure Parentage
in compatrison of Ethelred, who. was the Son ry‘so very great a
King as Edgar. Ethelredus inleetl calls her Father nobitiffi-

not that he thought that his Daughter was a proper Matchfor
Edmund. Yhis inequality therqbren‘Birth made the Writers

that this Ltdy was really hir wife, andrenseqnently that Mr.
Tyrell's Interpretation is forced end unnaturaL (which it
what I was te preve) appearssrem the Jtedgrnent nn only ef
the best Historiatts that have written fince the Refotmatiott‚

Athelredi regis Edmundus filius suus ex prima conjuge, filia

he ready to defend his Opinion hy the Antherity of John Brom-
