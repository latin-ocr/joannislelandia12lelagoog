⁵ a. Hessos ² was the first Abbat here, aiz. Aa 67 ς. He
died in the time of King Athelard‚ and was succeeded by
’ 2. Constans b, who is also called Cumanus.

3ss Ranrr'uuos ⁸ occurre Abbat next. A0. 814. he was ac·
cording to Heylin⁶‚ made Bilhop os Dorchester. Godwiu t
also notes ⁶ that lae was Bishop os this Place, but omitts this '
Circumstance os the time os his Advancentent, tho’ he tells
us that he died Anno 851. which Ilook upon as a Mistake.
This is certain that he was succeeded in his Abbatlhip by

4. Crrrarrtus f, aster whose Death, which fell out after the
Year 831. the Monks sorsoolt this Abbey, audit continued ‚l
desolate and ruinous 'till the Year 954, when it was restored ¹
by the means os St. Dunstau, and

5. Ernanwonns was appointed Abbat in thatYear. He
was a great Benesasior to this Monallery, whichh when
given to him was but very small, 'and wanted many eonve-
niencies; sor which reason he clearly renew'd ¹ and augment·
edit, at the same tinae digfiiug aud causing aGut to come l
out of tlte lsrs by force to erre and purge the Offices os the
Abbey. , And it was at this time that rhe Workrnen found
divers strange Things and Tombs, and amongst ¹( rhem a
Cross with an Inscriptiou. He built the Abbey Choreb, and
dedicated it ro the blelsed Virgin, and gave great Ornaments
to it; butl the Church and other Buildings that he eree‘ied ¹
were afterwards taken down and new made by Norman Ab·
bats in the first Norman Kings Times. He was consecrated
1¹¹ Bilhop of Wincheller Anno 963. and was the greatest
rounder os Abbeys in that Age. He died tire first os August
At. 984. He was succeeded in his Abbatship ΑΟ. 963. by

susurrus, as we learn frons the old History os this
Monallery printed in Anglia Sacra ⁰, tho' Gudwin tells ⁰ us
that Alsslanus was Abbat of Abbingtou much about this
time, that he was made Bilhop os SherburneA0. 970. and
dying A⁰. 98r.was buried at Abbingron. ButI am rather in·
clineu to follow theold history. Olgarus Ρ was a Man emi·

than ordinary Care os the Abbey and performed confiderable
Things sor it. It wasia his time that Sidemaune Bilhop os
