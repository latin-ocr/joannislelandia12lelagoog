T-his Abbey ⁶ was first begun at Bagley Wood‚ two Miles
higher on the River. This is Leland's Remark, and the
Publilher of him takes f the Place to have been Chilswell· 2
Farm at the West End of a great Field (commonly called

 

’ Hincksey·Field) on the North Side of Foxcomb Hill. But 1

the Abbey not prospering here, it was transsated hence to
Sewloelharn, which afterwards lost it’s Name, and was called
‚Abbingtom i. e. Abbatiae oppidum.

At St. Hellen's ἒ Church in this Town was sometime a
Nunnery, where there was afterwards an Hospital of fix Men
and ¹(ix Women. It is at this time a Parilh Church, and there
is the greatest Resort to it in the Town. But in old time ¹¹ ’
the chief Parish Church was St. Nicholas’s by the Abbey,
near which ¹ was an Hospital of St. john Baptist for twelve
Men, tho’ in another Place k our great Antiquary tells us
that there were only fix. This Hospita] was afterwards an· ¹
next to St. Nicholas‚ and the Inhabitants can give but little
better account of it, than they can of St. John’s Church which
stood ¹ by the Alms-House‚ without the Abbey-eGate. '
