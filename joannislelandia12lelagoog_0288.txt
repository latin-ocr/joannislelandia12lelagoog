o Itis very ralh for any one, especially for scholare, to attempt the
Alteration of ancient Monumepts that they may be the more couveniently
placed. Truly learned and jndicious Men make great use of the Fornr
and Figure of the Stones, and when any of the Words are wanting they
· will r'rorn the Bigness guther what the (lmilhons are, and will give pro·

buhle Guelles how they are to be supplyecl. My Lorcl Arundel was very
cautious in this Affair. He knew the true Use to be made of ancientMarbles.

He did not therefore make the least Alteration in so much as one of those

he purchased. But on the contrary he laid his lnjunetions upon those that

were to convey them over, and to snt «them afterwards, to preserve thern
intire as they were found, He did not think the least Bit of Marblesu-
perfluous. Neither wotld he suffer any Letter ro he either renewed or de·
“ faced. tt is therefore very much ro be lamented‚ that the same care hath
not been taken by others of sueh kind of Monuments; but that they have
been permitted to be cut and mangled and otherwise altered, for which
tho' spccious Reasons have been assigned, yet 1 am afraid that this Liberty
will, at sometime or other, draw severe Rellexions upon the Proprietors
from some Belgick or other ohservlng Criticks, who have better Reason to

aninradvert upon this account than they had for takingacertain learned ’
